# TREE PREDICTORS FOR BINARY CLASSIFICATION

The objective of this project is to design and implement a binary decision tree from 
scratch and evaluate its performance on a mushroom dataset.  
The primary goal is to classify mushrooms as either poisonous or edible based on a 
range of distinguishing attributes.  
For operational simplicity the project could be divided into different tasks.  
The initial task involves a thorough analysis of the dataset, followed by preprocessing 
steps such as splitting the data into training and test sets and finally cleaning.  
The core task revolves around constructing a decision tree predictor, where single
feature binary tests are applied at each internal node. As part of this process, a node 
structure will be designed, and a tree predictor class will be implemented to train on 
the dataset and generate predictions for unseen data through the “fit” and “predict” 
functions.
